<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Folklift Solid Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cured-on Solid Tire</li><li>Pressed-on Solid Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Forklift solid tires come in two main types: cured-on solid tires and pressed-on solid tires. Cured-on solid tires are manufactured by bonding rubber compounds directly onto the tire, providing a strong and durable option for heavy-duty applications. On the other hand, pressed-on solid tires are mounted onto rims with a press, making them easier to replace when worn out. Both types offer long-lasting performance and are commonly used in industrial settings for forklifts and other heavy machinery.</p></p>
