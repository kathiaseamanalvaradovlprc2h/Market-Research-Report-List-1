<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intraocular Pressure Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Monitors</li><li>Non-Contact Monitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intraocular pressure monitors are devices used to measure the pressure inside the eye, which is known as intraocular pressure (IOP). There are two main types of IOP monitors: contact monitors and non-contact monitors. Contact monitors involve direct contact with the eye, usually through a probe or a tonometer. They are more invasive and require topical anesthesia, but provide more accurate measurements. Non-contact monitors, on the other hand, use a puff of air or laser to measure IOP without touching the eye. They are less invasive and more comfortable for the patient, but can be less accurate compared to contact monitors.</p></p>
