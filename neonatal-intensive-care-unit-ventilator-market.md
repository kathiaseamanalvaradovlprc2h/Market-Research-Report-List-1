<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) ventilator market comprises two main types - invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators involve the use of an endotracheal tube to deliver air directly to the baby's lungs, typically used for more severe respiratory issues. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, deliver air through a mask or nasal prongs, suitable for less severe cases or to prevent further respiratory distress. Both types of ventilators play a crucial role in providing respiratory support to newborns in the NICU.</p></p>
