<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Common Rail Direct Injection (CRDI) System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SDI</li><li>TDI</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Common Rail Direct Injection (CRDI) system is a fuel injection technology used in modern diesel engines to improve efficiency and performance. There are two main types of CRDI systems: Single Direct Injection (SDI) and Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI). SDI systems have a single fuel injector per cylinder, while TDI systems use a turbocharger to increase the air pressure in the combustion chamber, resulting in better fuel atomization and combustion. Both types of CRDI systems offer better fuel economy and lower emissions compared to traditional fuel injection systems.</p></p>
