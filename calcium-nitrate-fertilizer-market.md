<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calcium Nitrate Fertilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crystalline</li><li>Granular</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Calcium nitrate fertilizer is available in two main market types: crystalline and granular. Crystalline calcium nitrate is composed of small, uniform crystals that dissolve easily in water, making it ideal for foliar application or hydroponic systems. Granular calcium nitrate, on the other hand, consists of larger particles that are best suited for soil application, providing a slow release of nutrients over time. Both types are popular choices for providing calcium and nitrogen to plants for healthy growth and development.</p></p>
