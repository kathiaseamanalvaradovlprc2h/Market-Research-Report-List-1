<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Bragg Gratings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uniform Fiber Bragg Grating</li><li>Non Uniform Fiber Bragg Grating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiber Bragg Gratings can be divided into two main types: Uniform Fiber Bragg Grating and Non-Uniform Fiber Bragg Grating. Uniform FBG has a consistent period and refractive index modulation along the length of the grating, resulting in a uniform reflection wavelength. On the other hand, Non-Uniform FBG has variations in period and refractive index modulation, leading to multiple reflection wavelengths. Both types have unique applications in industries such as telecommunications, structural health monitoring, and sensing systems.</p></p>
