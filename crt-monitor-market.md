<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CRT Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Random-Scan displays</li><li>Raster-scan displays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Random-scan displays in CRT monitors use a point-to-point communication method, allowing the electron beam to directly target and illuminate any point on the screen. This technology is less common and mainly found in high-performance applications such as medical imaging and flight simulation. On the other hand, raster-scan displays are more widely used in consumer CRT monitors, where the electron beam sweeps horizontally and vertically across the screen in a controlled pattern to generate the image. This technology is more cost-effective and suitable for everyday use.</p></p>
