<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Starter Motor and Alternator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Forced Engagement</li><li>Flexible Engagement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the automotive starter motor market, two main types are forced engagement and flexible engagement. Forced engagement starters have a fixed engagement position and are typically used in older vehicles. On the other hand, flexible engagement starters allow the pinion gear to move freely, reducing the risk of damage and providing a smoother start. Both types serve the purpose of converting electrical energy into mechanical energy to start the engine, but they have different mechanisms for engaging with the engine.</p></p>
