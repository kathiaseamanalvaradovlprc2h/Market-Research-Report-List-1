<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Gudgeon Pin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Pin</li><li>Full Floating Pin</li><li>Semi-Floating Pin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automotive Gudgeon Pin Market includes three main types: Fixed Pin, Full Floating Pin, and Semi-Floating Pin. Fixed Pin gudgeon pins are securely fixed to either the connecting rod or the piston. Full Floating Pins are entirely separate from the connecting rod and piston, allowing for more flexibility and reduced friction. Semi-Floating Pins are a combination of the two, with one end fixed to the connecting rod and the other end free to move within the piston. Each type offers its own advantages and is used in various automotive applications.</p></p>
