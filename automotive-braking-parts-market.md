<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Braking Parts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brake Lines</li><li>Disc Brakes</li><li>Drum Brakes</li><li>Brake Calipers</li><li>Pistons</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive braking parts market consists of various components such as brake lines, disc brakes, drum brakes, brake calipers, and pistons. Brake lines are responsible for transferring braking fluid from the master cylinder to the brake calipers. Disc brakes use friction to slow or stop the vehicle, while drum brakes use friction generated by brake shoes pressing against the inside of a drum. Brake calipers house the brake pads and apply pressure to the disc or drum, while pistons help to push the brake pads against the rotors for effective braking.</p></p>
