<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acidic Paint Remover Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oily</li><li>Paste</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The acidic paint remover market is categorized into two types: oily and paste. Oily paint removers are formulated with solvents that have high evaporation rates, making them more suitable for quick removal of paint layers. They are often used for larger surfaces or industrial applications. On the other hand, paste paint removers have a thicker consistency and are typically applied where controlled dwell time is desired, such as intricate surfaces or areas where the remover needs to cling to vertical surfaces without dripping. Both types offer effective solutions for removing paint, but their applications and characteristics differ.</p></p>
