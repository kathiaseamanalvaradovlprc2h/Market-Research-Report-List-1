<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photographic Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Long Pass Filter</li><li>Short Pass Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Long pass filters are optical filters that allow longer wavelengths to pass through while blocking shorter wavelengths. They are commonly used in photography to enhance warm tones and create a sense of depth in landscape shots. Short pass filters, on the other hand, do the opposite by allowing shorter wavelengths to pass through while blocking longer wavelengths. They are often used in black and white photography to enhance contrast and create a dramatic effect in the final image. Both types of filters play a crucial role in the world of photography by allowing photographers to manipulate the light entering their camera lens to achieve a desired effect.</p></p>
